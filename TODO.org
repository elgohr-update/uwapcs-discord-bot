* Reaction Roles

_Involves: File r/w + parsing, discord reactions_

So, for reaction roles, afaict this is what needs to be done

 - [X]  Migrate config.rs to something like ~config.yml~
 - [-] Complete ~reaction_roles.rs~
     - [X] Load from config (roles, and the rr msg, if they exist)
     - [X] Monitor reactions, update user roles etc.
     - [ ]  On updated to ~config.yml~ (and on bot load, now that I think of it) overwrite the rr msg with content based on roles in config

* LDAP Integration

_Involves: LDAP r/w, email,discord nicknames+roles_

- [ ] Add a ~discord_ID~ or similar field to the LDAP database
- [ ] Add a ~!link <ucc-username>~ command, which
  - [ ] Created a verification token
    - [ ] Perhaps just hash discordID+username with hardcoded salt (is this bad?)
  - [ ] Sends an email with a verification token (and instruction to ~!register~)
  - [ ] Goes back to discord and run ~!register <token>~
- [ ] Add a ~!register <token>~ command
  - [ ] Do hash, compare, if same update LDAP database
  - [ ] Either add ~registered~ role or remove ~unregistered~
    - [ ] End result, unable to change nickname
  - [ ] Set nickname to something like ~<tla> (<first-name>)~
- [ ] Add a ~!unlink~ command
  - [ ] Remove LDAP entry
  - [ ] Make able to change nickname again
- [ ] *Bonus:* be able to specify nickname format for registered users in ~config.toml~, and add way to update

* Fun with accounts

-   ~!dispense <item name>~
    -   Dispense the item
